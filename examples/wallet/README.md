# Wallet Example (React, Typescript, Ethers, NextJS, Cosmos)

This example aims to demonstrate basic and advanced use cases enabled by WalletConnect's Sign SDK.

**The wallet implements Sign v1 and v2 side-by-side**, to serve as a reference for wallet developers
aiming to support both major versions for backwards compatibility. **All files containing code for the legacy
v1 implementation are prefixed with `Legacy...`.**

Please only use this for reference and development purposes, otherwise you are at risk of losing your funds.

## Getting started

Example is built atop of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) in order to abstract complexity of setting up bundlers, routing etc. So there are few steps you need to follow in order to set everything up

1. Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in) and obtain a project id

2. Add your project details in [WalletConnectUtil.ts](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/utils/WalletConnectUtil.ts) file

3. Install dependencies `yarn install` or `npm install`

4. Setup your environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Your `.env.local` now contains the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` (placeholder) - You can generate your own ProjectId at https://cloud.walletconnect.com
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RELAY_URL` (already set)

5. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start local development

## Navigating through example

1. Initial setup and initializations happen in [_app.ts](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/pages/_app.tsx) file
2. WalletConnect client, ethers and cosmos wallets are initialized in [useInitialization.ts ](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/hooks/useInitialization.ts) hook
3. Subscription and handling of WalletConnect events happens in [useWalletConnectEventsManager.ts](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/hooks/useWalletConnectEventsManager.ts) hook, that opens related [Modal views](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/views) and passes them all necessary data
4. [Modal views](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/views) are responsible for data display and handling approval or rejection actions
5. Upon approval or rejection, modals pass the request data to [RequestHandlerUtil.ts](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/utils/RequestHandlerUtil.ts) that performs all necessary work based on the request method and returns formated json rpc result data that can be then used for WalletConnect client responses
